# D08 Plant List

A plant catalog for use in the field on mobile devices.

The web app as used in D08 during the 2015 season:
https://d8plants.cloudant.com/app/plant-list/index.html

## Lists

Search plants by common name, scientific name, or USDA code.
Synonyms are also searched (e.g. searching for "Acer barbatum"
will return both _A. floridanum_ and _A. rubrum_).

Tap the "hamburger" icon in the top left corner to switch between
viewing all plants expected in the region, or one of several
named sub-lists (2014 diversity data, 2015 unknowns in TALL and DELA).

Plants shaded in yellow have were found at a plot in 2014.  Unknowns
shaded in green were identified.  Plants with growth forms identified
by USDA include color-coded boxes on the right side of the screen
(T=tree, S=shrub, V=vine, Fn=fern, F=forb, G=graminoid).

## Details

Tap on a plant to view defaults (this screen is not polished).

Identified plants include additional details such as family, synonyms,
and a link to the USDA plants page.  Unknown plants include collection
details.
